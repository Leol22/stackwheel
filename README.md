<h1>stackwheel</h1>
stackwheel is an esoteric programming language made in 1 hour 15 minutes (the time i had available during class). The documentation was also rushed so i'm sorry.
<h2>basics</h2>
"stackwheel" is a functional programming language based on two "wheels" and an accumulator. The acc, which we will call layer 1 from now on, stores a single int value and is the main i/o for the language. Then, you have layer 2, a wheel comprised of 16 integers. These will be used as storage but most importantly as the operators for math. Finally layer 3, a wheel of 16 stacks, for data storage.
